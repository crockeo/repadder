# Repadder

Repadder is a tool to match controller inputs to keyboard inputs. My use case of
it is for playing videogames that don't support controllers. For instance,
[Risk of Rain](http://riskofraingame.com) is a game I love to play, but it
doesn't officially support DInput controllers. So instead I've created a mapping
for it to play on my Logitech F310.
